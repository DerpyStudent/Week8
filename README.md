A permanent magnet creates rotation when it reacts with the field of the electromagnet in the center of a motor.

Brushes are carbon electrical contacts connected to the commutator.

For this scenario, I would use a stepper motor, as it offers a full 360 degrees of rotation. A servo motor is limited to 180 degrees.
